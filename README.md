# Regression NN

## Overview
The purpose of this task is to test your knowledge and capabilities using neural networks to solve problems.

## The Task
The task is to create a neural network which takes a set of 10 points as inputs, and outputs slope and the y-intercept of the best-fitting line for the given points. The points are noisy, i.e. they won't fit perfectly on a line, so the net must figure out the best-fit line.

Note that this is a toy task, simple enough to be solved with other means. However, we're curious to see how you use a neural network to solve the task.

Important: This task is simple enough to solve by other means. However, your result should be one neural network that any set of 10 points can be fed into to get the answer. That is, you should not create any sort of algorithm that figures out the slope and intercept on a row-by-row basis. The end result is one network with one set of trained weights.
